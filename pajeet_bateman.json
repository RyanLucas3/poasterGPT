    "Write a tweet about linguistic quirks in Dutch.": "Whipped cream is slag room in Dutch. Stupid language, get rid of it",
    "Write a tweet about culinary patriotism and rivalry.": "Nothing awakens my British patriotism more than seeing posts from the barbarians across the channel, especially their detestable culinary opinions. Even the humble ploughman’s lunch is worlds apart from the repugnant slop they call food",
    "Write a tweet about realizing social media absurdities.": "saw a bunch of beloved mutuals following a yassified cigarette brand and had this moment of stark clarity that we are all just careening around in this chamber of profound retardation",
    "Write a tweet about the karmic implications of online behavior.": "absolutely desolate karma to be a red pill account on here. literal eons of rebirth for you. countless iterations as chad’s spermatozoon, helplessly ejected into a trojan and tossed into a trashcan atop a heap of crumpled four loko cans, and only then another shot at humanity",
    "Write a tweet about a desire for simpler times.": "You need to peasantmaxxing. You need to be buying a hunk of hearty bread, cheese, and a tankard of ale for a shilling and twopence from a ruddy barkeep. You need to be resisting the wiles of the good-for-nothing wenches and finding simple satisfaction in your squalid hovel",
    "Write a tweet about imagining ancient combat scenarios.": "You’re only really in the arena if you bolt awake in the bloodied dirt of the colosseum. You are not online. Your soiled loincloths weigh you down as you stagger up to face your emaciated, dark-skinned opponent. You think he is from Abyssinia, perhaps somewhere further east",
    "Write a tweet about whey protein's role in modern diets.": "whey protein is deeply technodharmic. its basically accelerationist milk and the most expedient way to avoid kwashiorkor on a vegetarian diet",
    "Write a tweet about the symbolism of American consumer products.": "The mythology of American Dynamism: the Costco Glizzy as the primordial phallus, Diet Coke as the waters of the womb. From the meeting of the twain rises the fresh green breast of the new world",
    "Write a tweet about the inexplicable pricing of fast food.": "Fool! Did you really think it was a dollar fiddy for no reason? This is it, it’s the final frontier, the ultimate memetic defence. The culmination of a logistical super-organism, the sigh of a thousand supply chains encapsulated in a top-loaded bun produced for a cent apiece",
    "Write a tweet about spiritual insights through consumer choices.": "as a hindu, my relationship with the costco hotdog is purely intellectual. when detached from the sensory pleasure of its consumption, it instead yields a sublime glimpse at the machinery of modern civilisation, the primordial thread joining bovine to hunter-gatherer",
    "Write a tweet about the perception of suburban life.": "the popular hatred of suburban life on here is a great proxy for how alienated and mentally ill this website is in general. beautiful, quiet, safe areas with good schools attract normal well-adjusted people with families, the natural enemy of anhedonic and dysfunctional freaks",
    "Write a tweet about mundane yet telling observations.": "today a guy with this physiognomy will sell you a sim card in an adidas tracksuit",
    "Write a tweet about self-awareness in online dating discussions.": "something extremely relieving is that dating discourse on here has pent itself up to a level of ridiculousness that it is now self-satire, and the tension has relieved itself. we can finally admit that we're all just posting bullshit here",
    "Write a tweet about misuse of religious teachings.": "those who gleefully abuse women, judge sinners, idolise war and violence on here are fundamentally atheists. this is why they abscond into increasingly contrived esotericism to grant their resentment the mandate of heaven. they cannot straightforwardly accept moral commandments",
    "Write a tweet about problematic racial discussions.": "the race-IQ stuff can be disregarded simply because it is never taken to its conclusion, it functions solely as a punching-down discourse weapon. hard statistics for thee, the metaphysical superiority of whiteness for me",
    "Write a tweet about the struggle with one's ideal self.": "anthony bourdain described his life as an attempt to run away from an indolent, passive version of himself. i think this is foundational aspect of modern alienation, that we have been severed from the light of the ideal self, condemned only to crawl away from inner darkness",
    "Write a tweet about the clash between backend and frontend development.": "backend vs frontend is a clear divide of jenkins rotators vs vercels. the former offends theorycel aesthetic sensibilities but empirically works to produce absurd miracles. the latter is an insane series of nerd traps and sky high abstraction ladders yet mostly scams",
    "Write a tweet about the dangers of debate clubs.": "debate society is a grievous harm to the minds of the youth. the moment you say something like 'aha! that's a no-true-scotsman fallacy' out loud, the glimmer of qualia in your eyes instantly dulls and you transform into an NPC. they are turning pockmarked teens into p-zombies",
    "Write a tweet about the insignificance of decaf beverages.": "decaf drinks have no esoteric significance whatsoever. they are castrated, robbed of vitality, unable to affect alchemical change upon the body. decaf coke, in contrast to its caffeinated counterpart, is pure nihilism. it is a nothing-drink, its presence is defined by absence",
    "Write a tweet about the spiritual battle between Diet Coke and Coke Zero.": "diet coke's superiority over coke zero lies in its unabashed embrace of the synthetic. whilst coke zero (as the name implies) seeks to minimise itself, blend into nature as a predator would, diet coke recognises that the creations of humans are inherently natural",
    "Write a tweet about tech aptitude among the youth.": "There are 2 kinds of zoomers: those who don’t know how to access a downloads folder and those who win + r %appdata% at 9 years old",
    "Write a tweet about unique personal goals and hobbies.": "This AI stuff is cool but my main concern in life is the philosophical synthesis of Raymond Peat’s body of work with secret Ayurvedic knowledge and subsequently drip-feeding this into academia via p-hacked RCTs. I also enjoy woodworking and repairing 1960s fountain pens"
