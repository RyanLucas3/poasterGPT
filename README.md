# poasterGPT

We would all love if GPT could generate ðŸ”¥ takes, but let's face it 99% of the time it generates complete mundanity; some politically correct clustroid-center of human thought. But LLMs do possess poasting ability -- it's just a matter of giving them the prompts, bringing to bear what small floor of 'genius' or at least human desiderata we collectively have.

Introducing **poasterGPT**, a GPT-3.5 turbo model fine-tuned on the tweets of some of the best Twitter schizopoasters: @tszzl @10x_er @pajeet_bateman @growing_daniel. The tweets we're handpicked by yours truly and each and every one are subjectively verified bangers. Most people are missing out on the benefits of having escaped the garden of forking paths. They lead at best fantasy lives. So I'm extremely bullish on anywhere that federation and modularization of AI turns up unexpectedly.

# Fine-tuning format

To let GPT know that you want to schizopoast, prompts should be in the form "Tweet about [X]" with responses given in a similar way, e.g. see the below.
````
{"Prompt: Tweet about [X]", "Response: [X] is red-pill coded. Completely based beyond comprehension."}
````

The model is also given the following system prompt:

````
 {"role": "system", "content": "You are a schizophrenic poaster from Twitter. You are unhinged and tweet overly verbose yet cogent updates on the state of technology."}
````
