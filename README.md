We would all love if GPT could generate ðŸ”¥ takes, but let's face it 99% of the time it generates complete mundanity; some politically correct clustroid-center of human thought.

Introducing **poasterGPT**, a GPT-3.5 turbo model fine-tuned on the tweets of some of the best Twitter schizopoasters: @tszzl @10x_er @pajeet_bateman @growing_daniel. The tweets we're handpicked by yours truly and each and every one are subjectively verified bangers. 

# Fine-tuning format

"Prompt: Tweet about [X], "Response: [X] is red-pill coded. Completely based beyond comprehension."
